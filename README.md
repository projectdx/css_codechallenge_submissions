## Project Description

Renewable Funding has decided to enter the lucrative market of apparent-solar-time analysis.

We want a user to be able to use our site to view an engaging design representing the sunrise and sunset in Portland, OR for:

1. The month of July 2017
1. The week of July 2, 2017
1. July 4, 2017

These times can be viewed at [sunrise/sunset](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/portland-or).

The design should:

1. make data easy to understand
1. be visually cohesive
1. be responsive (small and large viewports)
1. demonstrate well-structured CSS/SASS

It does not:

1. have to be dynamic (no API calls, user interactions, etc.)
1. have to be a single webpage, multiple pages are okay
1. have to be served, plain ol' HTML files are okay

#### Bonus options:

1. effective use of css transitions to enhance the user experience
1. use of BEM notation
1. appropriate use of css precompiler (SASS/LESS) features (mixins, etc.)

## Evaluation

Reviewers will assess your familiarity with standard libraries and single-page app best practices.

1. Did your application fulfill the requirements?
1. Did you document the method for setting up and running your application?
1. Did you follow the instructions for submission?
