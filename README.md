Renew Financial’s CSS Code Challenge
====================================

  Hi there! We're ecstatic that you're interested in working for Renew Financial's team. To get a better idea of your current development and design skills, we'd like you to participate in the following code challenge.

##Overview
  
  Renew Financial wants to gather feedback from users on our websites. We have designed a feedback form that should work well for both mobile and desktop users. Your task is to implement the mockup and add any additional design details necessary to offer a good user experience.
  
##General Requirements

* Create a single page form based on the mockup provided in this repository.
* Make sure your form renders properly in Chrome and Mobile Safari.
* Avoid paid software.
* Avoid any open source CSS libraries like Bootstrap, Material, etc.

##Bonus Options

* Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) notation.
* Use of appropriate CSS precompiler like SASS or LESS with features like mixins etc.

##Submission Instructions

* Create your markup and CSS as a CodePen at [codepen.io]().
* Save your CodePen. You can save it using your GitHub or Facebook credentials, or anonymously.
* Make sure you can open the CodePen in an incognito browser window to verify we can view it (as in it’s saved properly and is publicly accessible).
* Email the link to the CodePen to codechallengeanon@renewfinancial.com. Put the position you are applying for in the email's subject and document the instructions for viewing it (this may be very simple).

##Evaluation

  Your submission will be anonymized before developers on our team review it. Reviewers will assess your familiarity with standard libraries and single web page application best practices like:

* Did your application fulfill the general requirements?
* Did you document the method for setting up and running your application?
* Did you follow the instructions for submission?

_Please email us at codechallengeanon@renewfinancial.com if you have any questions._
